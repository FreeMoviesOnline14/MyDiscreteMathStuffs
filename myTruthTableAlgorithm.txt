Constructing truth table of n variables tips:

lay out the "standalone" statement variables as follows. What I mean by "standalone" is that it's just the letter itself. No symbols.

p q r

now, above each statement variable, label it in descending order starting (n-1) as follow:

n = 3... so... (n-1) = 2;

"label" 	---> 2 1 0
"variables"	---> p q r

now, raise 2 to each label above the variables. The number you get from raising (2 ^ "label") will serve as the counter for creating an alternating patterns of T's and F's. This will be your algorithm for constructing the alternating pattern of T's and F's as follows:


2^2 = 4		2^1 = 2		2^0 = 1

   p		  q			r
    
   T		  T			T
   T		  T			F
   T		  F			T
   T		  F			F
   F		  T			T
   F		  T			F
   F		  F			T
   F		  F			F
   
   
Note: the number of rows is 2^n, where n is the number of statement variables. This is the general formula for truth table.
	  the total number of T's and F's is ((2^n) * n). 
	  the number of columns depends on the given problem.
